## About Uni-Dock

Uni-Dock is a high-performance molecular docking program that leverages the power of GPUs to accelerate the docking process by up to 2000 times compared to traditional CPU-based methods. It supports popular scoring functions like `vina`, `vinardo`, and `ad4`. Uni-Dock is part of the DeepModeling community and is designed for high-throughput virtual screening and molecular docking simulations.

## Features of the GUI

* **Easy-to-use Interface:** Simplifies the process of setting up and running docking simulations with Uni-Dock.
* **Input File Management:** Easily load and manage receptor and ligand files.
* **Configuration:** Interactively set up the docking parameters, including the search space, scoring function, and other advanced options.
* **Job Monitoring:** Monitor the progress of your docking jobs in real-time.
* **Results Visualization:** (Optional - if you have this feature) Visualize the docking results and analyze the binding poses.
